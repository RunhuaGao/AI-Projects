This is Sole Project For me

To run Code in command line:
please type the command in format as following:

python [python filename] [net filename] [query] [evidence] [value] [evidence][value]

For example, to implement Enumeration algorithm on alarm net, the query variable is a and evidence is B is True
and E is False
type as follows: python Enumeration.py aima-alarm.xml A B T E F
(B and E could change order E F B T also works)

Tips: 
  1: Please only input T to stand for True and F to stand for False
     each variable must be separated by at least by whitespace
  2: please place all code files and xml files under same folder to run the code
 
Algorithms and their correspond filename:

RejectionSampleing: RejectionSampling.py
Likehood Weighting Sampling:LikehoodWeighting.py
Gibbs Sampling:GibbsSampling.py
VariableElimination:VariableElimination.py
